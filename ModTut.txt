First of all, you're going to need to know how to code C#, if you don't know how to code in C#, I suggest you learn how before you attempt to make mods.

Next, you're going to need to get acquanted with the Unity Game Engine, which is what clustertruck is made with. I suggest you try downloading the free version, and reading over the documentation for the engine. You can visit their site at unity3d.com

Next, you will need to open up your favorite IDE, create a New Project. Find C#. From there, create a new Class Library.
On the bottom of that window, take note of the Location.

Then, on the right, in the Solution Explorer, rightclick References->Add Reference, and click Browse. Go to Clustertrucks's "Managed" folder, and choose TesseractModLoader.dll, Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll

Then add [this code](http://pastebin.com/cxBfq7SF).

Start() is called when the game starts.

Update() runs every frame in the game.

You put your mod's code that needs to run over and over again in Update, anything that needs to run at the games launch goes in the "Start".

After you're done coding, build your project.
Then navigate to the Location we covered above, and find a folder called "bin".
Then open it -> "Debug" and grab "YourModName.dll" and place that file in the Mods folder.

You're done!
